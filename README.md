Creatives Around location-based social platform for visual artists.

The idea of the app is to connect with other visual artists that are in your area.
The mission of the app is to hold space for visual artists,
from various fields and levels of skill,
to connect - inspire one another - and collaborate.

The app suggests profiles based on location and art forms.
OnceÂ the connection is confirmed by both sides, direct messaging between the users is available and the users are added as a connection.

This app is currently made for mobile only,
and is for the desktop version presented in an iframe.
